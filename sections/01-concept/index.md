# Concept

The software Mete.io was a web application for weather forecast with a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for better user experience.

Mete.io was developed in Python and Open-Meteo API was used for the actual weather data. For more information about Open-Meteo API click [here](https://open-meteo.com/).

The use case collection provide a overview of what the software Mete.io base feature should be, expected interactions with the software and to whom would be used.

For the **Use case** the main goal was to View Weather Forecast.

Goal Level: Summary view

Main success scenario:

1. Users open the forecast app;
   
2. Users select the region of interest;
   
3. Users obtain fast and accurate information.

There are possible extensions that can be implemented:

1. The user has agreed on geolocalization features and it shows the forecast for the region is in;
   
2. The user has defined a set of preferred regions and are shown as first options;

3. The user receives feedback in case of slowness server-side.


The **User Stories** helped understand which type of person may be interested in the product and what Mete.io tried to solve. Below a few examples:

1. As a student I want to know the weather for next week so that I can plan the outfit accordingly and schedule meetings based on the information.

2. As a worker I want to know the weather for the next week so I can choose which outfit to wear and what activities I can plan on the weekend.

3. As a person I want to know the weather for the next week so I can choose the best day to plan activities.






Here you should explain:
- The type of product developed with that project, for example (non-exhaustive):
    - Application (with GUI, be it mobile, web, or desktop)
    - Command-line application (CLI could be used by humans or scripts)
    - Library
    - Web-service(s)
    - Data processing toolkit (= Library + CLI, or Jupyter Notebook)
- Use case collection
