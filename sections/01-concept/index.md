# Concept

## Product type

**Mete.io** is a desktop/mobile application with a graphical user interface, developed using Python and Kivy, that **allows users to see weather forecasts and alerts for different geographic locations**.

The application interacts with an external weather data provider (Open-Meteo) and their public Web API presenting the retrieved information with a user-friendly interface.

## Users and usage context

The main users of Mete.io are individuals interested in checking weather conditions and forecasts.

### User Location

Users can be precisely located by using GPS, the most common geolocation protocol.

### Frequency of use

Interaction with Mete.io is expected to happen frequently and for a short period of time, typically once or several times a day.

### Used devices

The application is designed to run on desktop or mobile devices, using mouse and keyboard or touchscreen. The users access all the features of Mete.io by means of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### User roles

The system supports a single user role called Standard User.

Standard user: a person viewing weather data and alerts.

No administrative or privileged user roles are present.

### Data storage

The system stores only previously searched locations as local user data. No personal identification data is stored. 

Location data is used only to provide weather information and is not shared with third parties beyond the external weather API.
