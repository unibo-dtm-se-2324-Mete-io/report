# Self-evaluation

During the writing of the report, each member was responsible for their sections, but all decisions were agreed upon and both members reviewed all sections and provided feedback. 

The member Kireeva wrote sections 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 while the member Morello wrote sections 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Sections 11 and 12 were written by both members.

##  Kireeva Evaluation

Considering the fact that both members come from economic backgrounds and the project was carried out at the end of their academic career with limited time, the technical complexity was limited to conceptual descriptions and no artifact was created. 

Our team tried to compensate for the lack of code-specific implementation by providing more detailed examples with test logic examples and UI mockups. Even if the release and CI/CD couldn’t be implemented the team reasoned about their future implementation steps.

My design section could be more precise, I reasoned about design choices conceptually based on what was discussed in class and did extra research, but some distinctions were fuzzy and the lack of previous experience in software design has brought in some lack of precision which could have been cleared up later in practical implementation steps. 

##  Morello Evaluation

The major weakness of the project was the lack of an artifact, which created a situation of extensive research to try to cover sections that had topics focused on implementation details.

This affected the writing of the “Development” section because the “implementation details” part should be a practical demonstration of the previous theoretical construction, so not having real software to verify how correct our assumptions were led to a lot of uncertainties on all the next steps of the project.
