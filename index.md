## Abstract

This report describes Mete.io, a simple weather application developed as a theoretical software engineering project.

The goal of the project is to apply structured software engineering principles to the analysis, design, validation, and release planning of an application.

The application provides location-based weather information, including primary indicators, optional secondary indicators, 7-day forecasts with accuracy visualization, location search and history, and alerts for extreme weather events.

Functional, non-functional, and implementation requirements are defined to clearly separate system behavior, quality attributes, and technological constraints.

The system follows a layered architectural style, chosen for its clarity and separation of concerns. 

The report details the architectural components, domain modeling choices, interaction patterns, and data-related aspects, with particular attention to maintainability and testability. 

A validation strategy is described, including unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing, with intention to implement a test-driven development approach. 

Continuous Integration is addressed through the use of GitHub Actions, automating dependency management, test execution, and coverage reporting. Release management, licensing, versioning, and deployment considerations are also documented, even in the absence of an implemented codebase.

The project focuses on demonstrating how software engineering best practices can be applied to the full lifecycle of a system, from requirements to release and future development planning.
